Summary of each file in main repository branch

Demo1_ISR_rewrit.ino : an arduino sketch adapted from the code Ben Wrote for assignment 2, which moniterd the movement of a virtual robot according to how 2 encoders were moved, to moniter how our actual wheels are moving. Main advantage over use of Encoder library velocity calculation in ISR.


PIDController.ino: Arduino sketch with PID conroller from mini-project adjsuted to drive 2 motors for both wheels of the robot

Testcode_10_16.ino: combonation of the above listed arduino scripts to estimate position of the robot
